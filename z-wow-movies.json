      "description":"In March 2018, amidst the War in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sergeant John Kinley and his unit are ambushed by a truck bomb attack orchestrated by the Taliban during a routine vehicle inspection at Lashkargah, which claims the life of his interpreter. In need of a replacement, he is introduced to Ahmed Abdullah, a steadfast yet disliked interpreter, who claims he pursues the job only for money. During an undercover capture mission, Kinley learns that Ahmed was previously affiliated with the Taliban through the opium trade but had defected when the organization murdered his son. Ahmed later saves Kinley's team from being ambushed by a Taliban unit aided by a compromised Afghan National Army soldier, earning Kinley's respect. During another raid to check for a possible insurgent arms cache about 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of Bagram Air Base, Kinley's unit is attacked by Taliban reinforcements, who kill everyone except for him and Ahmed. The duo manage to escape on foot, killing several Taliban fighters in the process. Whilst attempting to return to the airbase by navigating through the mountainous Afghan terrain, they are once again ambushed by insurgents, who manage to wound Kinley, before clubbing him with a rifle butt, incapacitating him. Ahmed manages to kill the Taliban and resolves to take Kinley back to the air base. Receiving help from some sympathetic Afghans, Ahmed evades the Taliban hunting them, carrying Kinley over the country's treacherous mountain topography. Several days later Ahmed and Kinley are near Bagram but are attacked by Taliban fighters; Ahmed kills the fighters but is shortly thereafter apprehended by U.S. troops. Seven weeks later, Kinley, having been repatriated to his home in Santa Clarita, California, is completely unaware of how he was saved, but understands Ahmed's role in it. Upon learning that Ahmed and his family were forced to move underground owing to the duo's escapade having become local folklore, Kinley attempts to procure U.S. visas for them for over a month, but in vain. Emotionally tormented and rendered near sleepless by his inability to repay his indebtedness towards Ahmed, Kinley finally resolves to save him himself, enlisting the assistance of his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Vokes, to procure the visas. Returning to Afghanistan under the alias of Ron Kay, Kinley meets with Parker, a private military contractor, who promises to provide support on the condition that the former locates Ahmed first. Kinley meets Ahmed's brother Ali, a Taliban supplier who manages to smuggle Kinley across their territory; in the process, he kills two insurgents after nearly being caught at a road checkpoint, which alerts the Taliban. Vokes informs Kinley that the visas have been processed and are with Parker. Finally arriving at Ahmed's hideout, Kinley persuades him and his family to accompany him to the U.S. Meanwhile, Parker deduces Kinley's true identity; realizing the danger that the duo is in due to their value to the Taliban, he arranges for an AC-130 gunship and an Apache attack helicopter to provide air support. Concurrently, the Taliban mount an attack on Kinley, who manages to escape with Ahmed's family to the nearby Darunta Dam. Cornered by approaching Taliban units, the duo engage them in a protracted gunfight, which ends when they run out of ammunition. However, the AC-130 and Apache helicopter arrive and wipe out the attackers. Parker arrives from the other end of the dam with a relief column of anti-Taliban technicals. He tells Kinley he would have supported his mission gratis had he known upfront it was him. Escorted back to Bagram, the group boards an Airbus A400M leaving Afghanistan. The film's ending title states that in the aftermath of the Taliban's recapture of Afghanistan, over 300 Afghan interpreters affiliated with the U.S. military were murdered by the organization, with thousands more still in hiding.",

        "description": "The Tank is a movie about the monsters living under the creaky old house. When struggling California pet store owners Jules (Luciane Buchanan) and Ben (Matthew Whelan) learn they’ve inherited a substantial piece of coastline property in Oregon following the death of Ben’s mother, it seems like their financial woes have been resolved. So they trek up the coast with their daughter Reia (Zara Nausbaum) and family dog Archie to see what they’ve been left, discovering a boarded-up house covered in vines. The house looks promising but needs some work; however, the acres of coastline property are worth a pretty penny—even in the late 1970s, when the movie takes place. Still, newspaper clippings around the house suggest the area comes with a curse, spurred by a local legend about mysterious disappearances in the area. Ben’s father and sister, too, went missing before he was born. Doubtlessly, the family secrets have something to do with the old tank, which, connected to a system of caves, delivers fresh spring water to the house. A creature feature by New Zealand writer-director-producer Scott Walker (The Frozen Ground, 2013), The Tank is a juicy rendezvous with guy-in-a-suit monsters and gory practical effects. Unfortunately, Walker’s script is a by-the-numbers scenario, accented with clunky dialogue sold by the affable leads, Buchanan and Whelan. Watching the film, there’s something off about their delivery. It’s unclear whether their voices were entirely ADRed or if the actors delivered their lines with awkward English accents, but something seems not right throughout. Regardless, Buchanan stands out as a presence that commands this feature. Shooting in New Zealand and working with a local cast and crew, the movie’s Oregon setting seems commercially motivated to reach American markets. But a New Zealand cultural backdrop may have added some much-needed personality to these proceedings, and the shoreline shown throughout looks more like a primal jungle than forests along the West Coast.The first two-thirds of The Tank build tension effectively enough, aside from a few bumps along the way. Walker establishes a mystery around the deaths of Ben’s father and sister, the answers to which reside in his mother’s diary. While Jules reads her late mother-in-law’s inner thoughts about a “dark sadness,” this leads to some overwrought, blue-hued, slow-motion flashback sequences that appear haphazardly throughout the movie, lending faux gravitas. Meanwhile, Walker drops unsubtle hints of things to come: When, early on, Jules explains to Reia that an axolotl at their pet shop will “hunt on land” if taken out of the water, surely this is foreshadowing (though mostly inaccurate). Likewise, Walker introduces Chekov’s shed stocked with ammonium nitrate on the inherited property, promising an explosive scene later. To be sure, once Ben turns on the water pipes, he awakens a nest of blind, cave-dwelling creatures that start small but soon grow to a massive size (think salaMANder), using the forest that surrounds the house as hunting grounds. Walker’s approach to this juicy setup has plenty of antecedents. Universal’s classic Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and the Roger Corman-produced Humanoids from the Deep (1980) come to mind. For his monster design, Walker smartly inverts something lovable into something horrible—he turns everyone’s favorite meme-worthy amphibian into a horrific, oily creature with sharp teeth and a vaginal inner mouth, rendered with convincing practical effects. Scenes where Jules and Ben find themselves chest-deep in tank water, staring down an eyeless, subterranean creature that disappears below the surface, prove downright terrifying. Later, when Jules must rescue Reia from the monsters’ underground lair using a makeshift flamethrower, it’s modeled after Ripley saving Newt in James Cameron’s Aliens (1986). The allusionism throughout The Tank is sometimes distracting but not enough to rob the movie of its simple pleasures. Although the story makes much out of the family secrets angle, The Tank doesn’t build this aspect of the story well enough to land an emotional blow or impart an intriguing mystery. But Walker delivers gooey creatures and monster movie scares to spare. The visuals by cinematographer Aaron Morton keep the action clear in the many nighttime sequences set in the dark forest, rundown house, or underground tank, whereas the editing team often betrays spatial logic to create momentum and tension. This is never worse than the climax, which proves so visually confused that I was left with questions. For instance, we hear the family dog barking but never quite register his location in the escape, leaving this friend to animals more concerned about Archie than the human survivors. Along with a sense that this family resolved none of their conflicts and the threat remains on their property, The Tank left this critic unfulfilled, even on basic B-movie terms. Even so, there’s enough to be savored in Walker’s modest, hand-crafted execution to earn a mild recommendation as late-night fare.",

        "description": "Nixon Oil company inspector Paul Sturges is sent to a small Mexican town in Baja California, to check on El Diamante, an offshore oil rig. He brings his wife Ines and their two children, Audrey and Tommy, along for a vacation. Upon arrival, the family finds the town in ruins. The remaining locals are suspicious and unfriendly, and fear turns to anger when they learn that Paul works for the company that commissioned the oil rig. Paul, seeking to see if the rig is worth revitalizing or decommissioning, takes a boat to it. He arrives to find the rig, dilapidated, hazardous and surrounded by an oil spill, crewed only by two remaining rig workers, Chato and Junior, along with their pet chihuahua. After being harassed and stalked by the angry locals, Paul's family decides to follow in another boat. As the boat arrives, Chato and Junior begin to panic and fire flares as a 70-ton megalodon shark, the Black Demon (Spanish: El Demonio Negro), which is prowling the waters, begins to chase the boat.Barel aging to get onto the rig unscathed, the family is forced to watch as the megalodon destroys the boat that brought them to the rig, killing its captain. After witnessing the attack, Chato reveals to Paul that some lucky crew members escaped the megalodon, adding that the radio on the rig does not function and calls made to Nixon Oil for help were ignored. Nixon Oil knew about the oil spill coming from the rig but never cared to fix the problem. Later, Ines discovers the safety reports for the rig and notices that the warnings have been ignored, and Paul signed the documents approving the rig's revitalization regardless of the dangerous conditions. When she confronts Paul about this, he admits his mistakes and adds that he did what he did to provide for his family, stating his job and economic security would be at risk if he did not act according to the company's interests. Nixon Oil developed self-inspections to get away with ignoring hazardous working conditions and threatened Paul when he attempted to confront them over this. Ever since, he has been forced to work in Nixon Oil's self-interest, while the local community suffered as a result of the company's negligence and greed. While Chato and Junior dive underwater to restore power to the rig. Chato believes the megalodon to be a herald of the god of rain, Tlaloc, who punishes those who take greedily from nature. Underwater, Paul notices a demolition bomb attached to a leg of the rig. Nixon Oil have actually been aspiring to kill him all along; realizing their practices would be reported sooner or later and that they would be blamed for the oil spill, the company had Paul sign the paperwork so that he would take the fall and die when the bomb detonated. Junior is killed by the shark and Chato narrowly escapes. Realizing the danger and hoping to set things right, Paul dives underwater (as his family and Chato escape) to seal the oil spill and destroy the megalodon. Though he seals the leak, the megalodon forces him to hide in the structure of the rig. Strapping the bomb to his chest, Paul realizes that to kill the megalodon, he will need to sacrifice himself. Over his radio, Paul says his last goodbyes to his family before letting the megalodon consume him. The bomb detonates, killing the megalodon and causing the rig to collapse. While leaving, Paul's family intends to give the documents he gave them to the townsfolk so they can hold Nixon Oil accountable. As they sail back to shore, a fishing boat rescues the group as a rainstorm begins.",

        "description": "65,000,000 years ago, on the planet Somaris, pilot Mills is convinced by his wife that he should take on a two-year space expedition to earn the money needed to treat their daughter Nevine's illness. During the journey, his spaceship, the Zoic, is hit by a mass of asteroids and crash-lands on an alien planet, which unbeknownst to him, is actually Earth. With his ship damaged beyond repair, he finds that his passengers have been killed and contemplates suicide until he finds a lone survivor, a young girl named Koa. Mills sends a distress beacon for rescue and decides to take care of Koa. However, they have difficulty communicating due to differing languages and a broken translator.Mills later discovers a functioning escape shuttle from the Zoic has landed on top of a mountain. To encourage Koa to follow him, Mills lies about her family being atop the mountain, when in reality they perished in the crash. The pair quickly realize the planet is home to dangerous and aggressive alien creatures, which are actually Earth's dinosaurs. As Mills protects Koa, they begin to bondKoa watches several video messages sent by Nevine. The two are attacked by what appears to be a massive theropod, though Mills shoots it in the eye which only enrages it, forcing Koa and Mills to retreat further into a cave. After a rockfall separates them, Mills is attacked by an Oviraptor and Koa is attacked by a raptor-like creature which she traps in a fallen tree log; she uses bombs Mills had given her to kill the dinosaur. Mills kills the Oviraptor and escapes the cave, but falls into quicksand while searching for Koa. Koa rescues him and they continue up the mountain. Mills discovers that a huge asteroid, the same one whose debris his ship crashed into, will strike Earth in less than 12 hours.The two reach the escape shuttle, but Koa is angry when she discovers that Mills lied to her. Mills opens up to Koa about losing Nevine, who had died of her illness while he was away, and promises to protect her. Upon learning rescue is on the way, the two board the escape shuttle, but the asteroid's debris causes it to fall down the mountain. A pair of marauding Tyrannosaurus rex harass Mills and Koa, though Mills successfully kills both of them. Suddenly, the same predator Mills had partially blinded earlier, which turns out to resemble a hybrid of a theropod and a rauisuchid, also attacks. Mills manages to lure it toward a large geyser field while Koa stabs it in its remaining good eye with a large dinosaur claw that she coated in poison berries earlier, blinding it. The now blind carnivore then stumbles headfirst into a boiling hot geyser and is burned to death. The pair escapes just in time as the asteroid strikes Earth, causing a cataclysmic event and the extinction of the dinosaurs. With the pod set to meet up with a rescue vessel, the two relax and fly off into the stars.In closing titles, the evolution of Earth is shown, at the spot where Mills and Koa left, through an ice age until the present day. 65 is a 2023 American science fiction film written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. Adam Driver stars as a space pilot who crashes on an unknown planet and attempts to escape while surviving with a young girl, played by Ariana Greenblatt.

        "description": "Ariel is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of the merpeople of Atlantica. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbids all merfolk from surfacing there after Ariel's mother was killed by a human. One night, Ariel sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see them better. They come from the ship of Eric, the prince of a nearby island. When a storm arrives, the ship crashes against rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Ariel saves Eric, brings him to shore, and sings with her siren voice to help save his life. She flees before he can regain full consciousness.         Noticing Ariel's absent-minded behavior, Triton questions his advisor Sebastian the crab, who reveals that she saved a human. Enraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto to confront her; when she refuses to swear to never return to the surface, he destroys her collection of human objects. Ariel is later approached by two moray eels sent by the sea witch Ursula, Triton's estranged sister and Ariel's aunt, who was banished from Atlantica 15 years prior.         At Ursula's lair, Ariel is presented with a deal: she will turn into a human for three days, during which she must receive true love's kiss to remain human permanently. If Ariel fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and Ursula will claim her. To become human, Ariel must give up her tail, the ability to breathe underwater, and her siren voice, the last of which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell. Ariel accepts the deal. After receiving human legs, she is taken to the surface by Sergeant Major Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian. In the human world, she is rescued and taken to Eric's castle. Eric, who has been searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel. However, her lack of voice has him immediately turning away, though he does allow Ariel to stay in the castle for as long as she wants. While exploring the castle, Ariel finds Eric's collection of items he accumulated over his travels. Eric spends time with her poring over his collection.         The next day, Eric takes Ariel sightseeing around the kingdom. Sebastian, who has followed Ariel, realizes that Ursula has put a cheat in the spell that is causing Ariel to forget that she needs to kiss Eric. Along with Scuttle, a northern gannet, and Flounder, Sebastian takes it upon himself to get the pair to kiss. They are almost successful but are thwarted by Ursula's eels. Enraged by the close call, Ursula turns into a human and uses Ariel's siren voice to hypnotize Eric. Back at Atlantica, Triton has the kingdom search for Ariel and begins to regret the way he treated her.         The next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to Vanessa (Ursula's alter ego) later that day. Ariel rushes to the engagement party, confronts Ursula, and breaks the shell. She gains back her voice, and the enchantment on Eric is broken. However, before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Reverting to her original form, Ursula drags Ariel back into the ocean.         Wanting to save Ariel, Triton confronts Ursula. However, the deal that she made with Ariel is unbreakable. Triton trades himself for Ariel and is turned to dust by the eels, much to her horror. Ursula claims Triton's trident just before Ariel confronts her while Eric arrives. Ursula attempts to destroy Eric, but to save Eric the second time, Ariel intervenes and intentionally attacks Ursula, who unintentionally kills her eels. Enraged, she uses the trident to grow in size and summons a storm to threaten Ariel and Eric. Ariel gets on a surfaced ship. Ursula is about to kill Eric with the trident. Saving Eric the third time, Ariel kills Ursula and impales her with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula dies, Triton comes back to life. Ariel picks up Triton's trident and hands it back to Triton. Triton is proud of Ariel for saving Eric three times and killing Ursula. Triton and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them.         Ariel returns home, where she is unhappy without Eric. On Sebastian's advice, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she marries Eric. The pair decide to travel together, with the blessing of both their parents and the support of people from both their worlds.",

She is tasked by the peacekeeping operation known as Charter to keep the object safe from falling into enemy hands.[4]         Development began in December 2020, when Gadot signed on to star. Harper and Netflix were confirmed to serve as director and distributor respectively the following month, with the rest of the cast being confirmed in early 2022. Filming took place in Europe from January to July of that year.        Heart of Stone was released on August 11, 2023, by Netflix.In the Italian Alps at a ski resort/casino, MI6 field agents Parker, Yang, and Bailey, supported by technician Rachel Stone, are tasked with extracting Mulvaney, an arms dealer who is there gambling on a US Navy SEAL combat operation somehow being livestreamed. When Yang is caught trying to sedate Mulvaney, a gunfight breaks out. Parker manages to extract Mulvaney to a cable car while the team heads down the mountain to confront Mulvaney's security.        Stone feigns injury to stay back and contact a mysterious agent named Jack feeding her probability information about how to safely get down the mountain and neutralize the incoming security. She manages to avoid contact with her team, who do not realize she is undercover; while extracting Mulvaney, he apparently takes cyanide to commit suicide.        In London, Stone is reprimanded for risking her cover by Nomad, her superior. Concerned by the presence of a hacker she saw in the Alps, Stone discovers she is Keya Dhawan, an orphan with links to Indian criminal syndicates. Stone's organization, the Charter (which Bailey suspects exists), leaks MI6 Keya's location and sends them to track her down in with Stone still undercover. Upon arrival, they are ambushed by a squad of mercenaries. Jack orders Stone to evacuate, but she refuses, going back to save the team at the expense of her cover. After they escape, Stone reveals she is a Charter agent.        Parker murders Yang and Bailey, revealing himself as a double agent working with Keya. He admits to covertly murdering Mulvaney as part of his mission to find The Heart, a quantum computer used to guide the Charter's missions. Parker paralyzes Stone with poison before planting a device in her to act as a trojan horse to infiltrate Charter systems. When Stone is recovered and taken to Charter HQ, the device begins breaching security. Stone cuts out the device, but the hackers learn the Heart's location and Nomad suspends Stone.        Nomad meets with the other 3 Kings running the charter, who reveal that Parker was an MI6 agent deliberately left for dead during an operation the Charter botched in Chechnya 8 years prior. Having learned from the hack that The Heart's command system is located in an airship over Africa, Parker and Keya fly to the ship. Stone intercepts them, but is unable to stop them from seizing The Heart and destroying the ship. She cuts the rope ladder to their helicopter and she and Keya parachute into the desert.        Keya informs Stone that she biometrically encrypted the Heart, and it is useless without her. A jeep picks up Stone and Keya and takes them to a village, which turns out to be a setup by Parker. Keya is captured and Stone escapes, eventually being rescued by another Charter operative. Stone goes to Iceland, where Parker is using a university supercomputer to exploit the Heart.        Parker uses the Heart to kill the other 3 Charter Kings and several operatives as well as trap the Charter in their bunker without an air supply; Keya becomes disillusioned with him since she intended to use the Heart only for financial gain. She helps Stone avoid an explosion set in a decoy location and reroutes her to Parker and the Heart's true location. Parker realizes Keya has betrayed him, and tries to force her to unencrypt the Heart. Stone arrives in time to rescue her, and manages to kill Parker. Keya uses the Heart to restore oxygen to the bunker and turns it back over to the Charter.        Four weeks later, Stone visits Keya in prison and offers her a job in the Charter. They then take on another mission as a new team of Stone, Jack and Keya.",

        "description": "Peter Pan & Wendy is a 2023 American fantasy adventure film directed by David Lowery from a screenplay he co-wrote with Toby Halbrooks. Jim Whitaker served as producer on the Walt Disney Pictures production, which is a live-action adaptation of Walt Disney's 1953 animated film Peter Pan, in turn based on the 1904 play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (also known as Peter and Wendy) by J. M. Barrie. The film stars Alexander Molony (in his film debut) and Ever Anderson in the title roles. Jude Law, Yara Shahidi, Alyssa Wapanatâhk, Joshua Pickering, Jacobi Jupe, and Jim Gaffigan also appear in supporting roles. The story follows Peter Pan and Wendy, who go to the magical world of Neverland with Wendy's brothers and Peter's best friend Tinker Bell. Along the way, Wendy embarks on the adventure that will change her life and encounters Peter's archenemy Captain Hook. Development on a live-action Peter Pan film began on April 13, 2016, with Lowery directing. Lowery was announced as writing the film with Halbrooks, while the production team expanded the next four years due to work in the remake's script. The film's title was announced on January 7, 2020. Production was expected to begin in April 2020 and wrap in August that year but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in March 2021 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Shooting also occurred on the Bonavista Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador, in August 2021, and in the Faroe Islands.[2]        Peter Pan & Wendy premiered on Disney+ on April 28, 2023.In Edwardian London, Wendy Darling spends her last night at home with her parents and her two younger brothers, John and Michael, before leaving for boarding school the next day. She is unhappy with her departure and feels she does not want to grow up. Having heard Wendy's wish, Peter Pan arrives to take her to Neverland where she will never have to grow up. With the help of his companion, fairy Tinker Bell, Wendy, John, and Michael fly to Neverland.        Upon arriving, they are attacked by a ship of pirates, led by Captain Hook, who wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his right hand and throwing it to a crocodile. Wendy becomes separated from Peter and her brothers and meets Tiger Lily and the Lost Boys. She witnesses the pirates capturing John and Michael to drown them at Skull Rock. Peter fights the Captain, while Wendy, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys save John and Michael. Hook and the pirates are chased away by the crocodile.        Wendy learns from Peter that Captain Hook was once his best friend known as James, until he left Neverland and grew up to be a pirate. Hook's crew captures the Lost Boys and the Darling children, while the Captain attacks Peter, who seemingly falls to his death. Hook reveals to Wendy that the reason he left Neverland was because he missed his mother and wanted to find her. Eventually he got lost at sea and was rescued by his first mate, Mr. Smee, and the pirates, who raised him. When he returned to Neverland, Peter could not accept how much he had changed, and the two became enemies.        While Tiger Lily finds Peter and nurses him back to health, Hook forces Wendy to walk the plank, but she flies away with Tinker Bell's pixie dust and the happy thought of wanting to grow up. Tinker Bell flies the ship into the air with pixie dust, helping the Lost Boys break free and battle the pirates. Peter arrives to confront Hook, and after a long duel, finally apologizes to him for being a bad friend, but Hook does not want their rivalry to end. When Wendy turns the ship on its back, causing the pirates to fall off, Peter attempts to save Hook, encouraging him to fly, but without happy thoughts, he falls into the sea while losing his hook. Afterward, the Lost Boys decide they all want a real home, so they fly back to London on the ship with the Darlings.        Arriving home, Wendy introduces the Lost Boys to her parents. Peter reveals the Darlings' house was his old home until one day he ran away. Wendy suggests he stay, but Peter feels he is not ready to grow up. He bids farewell to Wendy and the Lost Boys, and returns to Neverland with Tinker Bell.        Back in Neverland, Hook and Smee are revealed to have survived the fall. Hook sees Peter returning on the ship and smiles happily.",

        "description": "No Hard Feelings is a 2023 American sex comedy film starring Jennifer Lawrence as a woman who is hired by a wealthy couple to romance their inexperienced son. The film is directed by Gene Stupnitsky from a screenplay he co-wrote with John Phillips. Along with Lawrence, who was one of the film's producers, the film stars Andrew Barth Feldman, Laura Benanti, Natalie Morales, and Matthew Broderick. 32-year-old Maddie Barker is an Uber driver and bartender in Montauk, New York. She is facing bankruptcy after her car is repossessed as she owes property taxes on a home she inherited from her mother. Desperate to avoid losing the home, she accepts an unusual Craigslist posting. Her new employers, Alison and Laird Becker, ask her to date their 19-year-old son Percy in exchange for a Buick Regal. Since Percy is shy and has had no experiences with girls, drinking, parties, or sex, his parents hope to boost his confidence before he attends Princeton University in the fall. Maddie attempts to seduce Percy at the animal shelter where he volunteers. However, after she offers him a ride home, he mistakenly thinks that she is attempting to kidnap him and pepper sprays her. Despite this, they agree to go on a date the following day. Maddie and Percy meet at a bar the next night and then go skinny dipping at the beach. While they are in the water, a group of drunken teenagers try to steal their clothes. Maddie fights them in the nude, frightening Percy, who refuses to have sex with her. When she tries to leave without him, he jumps on her car, naked, and they outrun the police. She and Percy attempt to have sex, but he develops a rash from his anxiety, so Maddie nurses him. Maddie and Percy continue to date, sharing more about themselves and forming a friendship. Both reveal that they never went to prom, so they imitate a prom night, going to a fancy dinner where Percy plays the piano. Percy meets a school acquaintance, Natalie, in the restaurant who invites him to a party. After he and Maddie have a disagreement about their long-term plans, he goes to the party while Maddie searches for him. She finds him with Natalie in bed, though nothing happened between them, after he took an ibuprofen with alcohol. After leaving the party Percy confesses his love for Maddie. The next day, Percy tells his parents he wants to stay in Montauk with Maddie instead of going to Princeton. In a panic, his father offers her the car if she convinces him to go to Princeton. Percy inadvertently hears Maddie's deal with his parents. He invites Maddie to dinner with his parents, implying that he knows about their deal. While Maddie and his parents ask each other if he was told about the deal, Percy crashes the Buick into a tree, heavily damaging it. When he returns, Percy tries to have sex with Maddie. After prematurely ejaculating during foreplay, a betrayed Percy ends their relationship. Maddie takes the damaged car and becomes determined to pay off her debts. After Ubering for the remainder of the summer, she manages to save enough money to save her home and fix her car. Excited, Maddie tells her friends, Jim and Sara, but Sara asks Maddie if she really wants to stay in Montauk or is just doing it for her mother. The couple also admit they are moving out of Montauk to Florida due to housing costs. Maddie reflects on her life and tries to amend her wrongs. She reunites with Percy at a Princeton mixer and apologizes for betraying him. Not convinced, Percy starts to drive off when Maddie jumps on the hood of his car. Unable to see, Percy crashes the car into the ocean. As the car is towed, the pair reconcile and promise to stay friends. Maddie decides to sell the house to Jim and Sara and move to California to pursue her passion for surfing. Later, Maddie drives Percy to Princeton while on her way to California, and reveals that she has adopted Milo, a former police dog addicted to cocaine who lived at the shelter where Percy had volunteered. Maddie promises to call Percy during her entire drive to California.",

        "description": "As a long-time fan of Bruce Willis, it grew tough watching his movies go from box office gold to straight to video garb. But when news came out of his declining health (he’s since been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia), it became clear why he had moved away from big studio productions and to smaller and easier roles. As a result of his condition, last year Willis’ family announced his retirement from acting. Suddenly movies didn’t seem all that important. Since 2019 he has appeared in 26 straight direct-to-video movies, many of which used him heavy in their promotions. Interestingly, he only had small supporting roles in most of them. The same is true with “Assassin”, a sci-fi thriller from first-time director Jesse Atlas that turns out to be the final film appearance of Willis’ impressive 43-year career. Unfortunately “Assassin” is yet another VOD dud but it certainly can’t all be put on Willis. There are several significantly bigger problems that end up dragging the movie down. Based on the short film “Let Them Die Like Lovers”, the movie has a premise that is ripe with potential. But it doesn’t have the budget or (more importantly) the creative know-how to pull it off. And it definitely doesn’t do enough for us to look past the uninspired performances, cringy dialogue, and painfully dull action. The story (written for the screen by Atlas and Aaron Wolfe) follows Alexa (Nomzamo Mbatha) who is shocked when her husband and fellow U.S. Army soldier Sebastian (Mustafa Shakir) comes back from his tour in a coma. Desperate to learn more about what happened to him, Alexa begins digging and discovers that Sebastian was actually on a super-secret mission working for a man named Valmora (Willis). Valmora and his associates Olivia (Fernanda Andrade) and Marko (Barry Jay Minoff) makeup a poorly defined black ops team who possess a technology that enables them to digitally map an agent’s consciousness into another person’s body. They can then use that body to carry out all kinds of missions, most notably assassinations. How it all works is anyone’s guess. The movie certainly doesn’t seem to care. All they need to pull it off is a bathtub, a laptop, and something that looks like an old car part (that’s what the movie tries to pass off as state-of-the-art tech). When Alexa finds Valmora he informs her that a dangerous fixer and smuggler named Adrian (Dominic Purcell) has stolen a tiny piece of their tech that must be recovered if Sebastian is to ever wake up from his coma (don’t ask). So Valmora recruits Alexa to take over the the minds of strangers and assassinate those close to Adrain leaving him vulnerable. Then she can take him out and steal back the tech that can bring back Sebastian. As you might expect they hit a few snags that by design usually adds tension to a story. That’s not the case here mainly because the movie shows no sense of urgency. There’s no energy or excitement. It toys with thought-provoking ideas and poses some meaty questions especially when digging into the moral queasiness of entering and controlling another’s body. “We kill the bad guys. Someone else takes the fall.” That line alone should provoke some compelling considerations. Unfortunately “Assassin” doesn’t do anything with the boxes it opens up. And that speaks to the movie’s biggest problem. Yes, “Assassin” is plagued with bad performances throughout and the action never (and I do mean never) gets to room temperature. But it’s the script that turns out to be the biggest liability. The wafer-thin characters fumble through equally shallow (and sometimes astonishingly lame) dialogue. There’s no worthwhile hero or villain. And the story has so many holes it quickly devolves into something impossible to latch onto. It’s truly heartbreaking to see Willis’ career end on such a sour note. But that doesn’t take away from the years of great characters, great energy, and great personality he has given us. From “Moonlighting” to “Die Hard” to “Pulp Fiction” to “The Sixth Sense” to “Moonrise Kingdom”. What a terrific filmography. And because of that, we will always be grateful. “Assassin” is streaming on Hulu”. ",

        "description": "Not letting the success of Ape vs Monster go to waste, The Asylum is back with Ape vs.Mecha Ape. This time, they’ve brought in Marc Gottlieb to write and direct. While it’s only his second feature, the other was Cousin Howard back in 1995, and the first one for The Asylum he’s written several scripts for them including Jungle Run, 2025 Armageddon, and Aquarium of the Dead. Can he kick the franchise into gear after its dismal first film? The film opens with a chemical weapons plant that looks like an old warehouse being attacked by what looks like the giant ape, Abraham. A few explosions later we see that it’s actually a giant, well-armed, robot which makes short work of the plant’s security. The real Abraham meanwhile is upset. A drone has gotten into his preserve and pissed him off. Sloane (Anna Telfer, Time Pirates, Planet Dune) has been called in to calm him down and the drone’s pilot, animal rights activist Joel (Jack Pearson, Attack on Titan, Shark Season) is being interrogated. Back in Volodrezjka, I guess Russia was too hard to spell, Pavla (Iris Svis, Stan the Man, Monday Coffee) is upset by the death of her son in the attack. And since his father Arnott (Xander Bailey, Bullet Train Down, Shark Waters) is a big shot in their foreign intelligence service, something will be done about it, and Mecha Ape will be the tool they use to do it.         With a title that recalls Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla and a plot inspired by King Kong Escapes, a recovered nuke and a high-tech spy Roomba, Ape vs.Mecha Ape is obviously meant to be taken with tongue in cheek. Given the highly variable quality of The Asylum’s output, the question is, which set of cheeks are we talking about?On a positive note, this is better than Ape vs Monster. The first half of the film is still mostly talk, but the effects we do see are of a better quality than those in the original. Sadly, most of Mecha Ape’s rampage is off-screen, and we just hear about it and see the damage until the final act when it tangles with Abraham. Helping to offset that, the plot for Ape vs. Mecha Ape isn’t as eye rollingly ridiculous and the dialogue moves the story along at a decent pace, so at least it doesn’t get as boring as many of their films before the now nuclear-equipped robot reaches Chicago.Making his Asylum debut as Secretary of Defense Hamilton Tom Arnold (True Lies, Dead Ant), as expected, has few scenes with the rest of the cast. Oddly the way the script is set up the same holds true for most of the rest of the cast as well, giving Ape vs.Mecha Ape a cut-and-paste feel to it.         Sloane spends most of the film inside the robot trying to shut it down. The Volodrezjkain agents have no scenes with the other main cast. Joel, along with Pierce (Corbin Timbrook, The Unhealer, The Belly of the Beast) and Laura (Lisa Lee, Love at the Lodge, Megalodon Rising) have a few scenes with Sloane at the beginning and end of the film but are together through most of it and have no scenes with anyone else.         When the title creatures finally do get to brawl, the Ape vs. Mecha Ape showdown is better than what we got in the first film. The effects are solid and there are more scenes of destruction, though still not as much as kaiju fans will be expecting. If it had included a couple of scenes of Mecha Ape vs. military action, this could have been a much better film. Instead, it doesn’t rise much above watchable, wasting an amusing plot and good effects in the process.",

Although Abby does meet with him at the designated time, she dresses in a decidedly non-sexy way, won't allow him to pay and clearly establishes they are only platonic friends. Travis tells her about his family, but she divulges nothing about herself before calling it a night.          When Abby's dorm has a water issue, Travis' cousin and Mer's boyfriend Shepley lets Abby stay in their apartment. Travis offers her a spot on his massive bed, but in the morning, she accidentally stimulates him.          After Abby has a dinner date with fellow student Parker, he takes them to watch a fight. Turning out to be another Travis fight, she talks with him beforehand, and he makes a wager with her, which he wins. As he won the match without his opponent touching him, Abby must stay in his apartment for a month.          A few weeks in, Travis takes Abby home to meet his dad and four brothers. Soon, they break out cards and chips for poker. Initially opting out, eventually they deal her in. When she cleans house, her Vegas background is revealed, that she is the infamous Lucky 13.          The following days they get closer and closer, culminating in Travis and Abby starting to get it on. Panicking, she throws him to the floor and seeks Mer. Abby believes she's in love with him, but before she can return, Travis bolts. He'd not known a message from Mick on her computer was from her father, who she'd avoided engaging with since she left Vegas. Abby leaves, furious, and is later found asleep in the library by Parker. After Shepley sends out an APB for her, he takes her to her surprise birthday party.          Drinking and dancing all night, Travis finds Abby, stops her drinking and nurses her. Thanks to him, by 1 p.m. she wakes, hangover free. After Travis gives her a full body massage, they finally make love. In the morning, back at her dorm, a car is waiting for her as her dad has a great debt to Benny.          Heading to Vegas, supposedly so Abby can pay back her father's $100,000 debt, she is successful and about to leave when a security guard she grew up with stops her. He confiscates the money as she's under 21. Told she still owes the money, Travis offers to participate in an amateur prize fight to win it back.          Meanwhile, Abby discovers it was a ruse, Mick's ploy to get her gambling for him. She gets the money back with a taser, then heads to stop the fight. Starting a fire as a distraction, she and recently arrived Shepley rescue Travis.",

        "description": "Jailer redirects here. For the Malayalam film, see Jailer (2023 Malayalam film). For other films, see Jailer. Jailer is a 2023 Indian Tamil-language action comedy film directed by Nelson Dilipkumar and produced by Kalanithi Maran of Sun Pictures. The film stars Rajinikanth in the lead role, alongside Vinayakan, Ramya Krishnan, Vasanth Ravi, Tamannaah Bhatia, Sunil, Mirnaa Menon, and Yogi Babu in supporting roles. Mohanlal, Shiva Rajkumar and Jackie Shroff play guest appearances. It revolves around a retired jailer seeking to apprehend an eccentric idol smuggler.        The film was officially announced in February 2022 with the working title Thalaivar 169, being the 169th film of Rajinikanth, while the official title Jailer was announced in June. Principal photography began in August 2022 in Chennai and wrapped in June 2023. The music is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Vijay Kartik Kannan and R. Nirmal.        Muthuvel Pandian is a retired police officer who lives in Kodambakkam with his family. Muthuvel's son ACP Arjun is investigating Varman, an eccentric gangster operating from his base of operations in Arakkonam, who smuggles idols of gods and sells them to buyers overseas. Arjun confronts Varman's henchman Seenu and demands him about the whereabouts of Varman. While getting close to nabbing Varman, Arjun suddenly goes missing and the police department covers this up by spreading word that he may have committed suicide due to the stress of the job.        Grieving the loss of his son and partly blaming himself for raising him to be honest and fearless, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and murders him, disposing the body by coercing a clueless local taxi driver Vimal into helping him. In retaliation, Varman's men attempt to kill Muthuvel's grandson Rithvik, but Muthuvel manages to save him. Muthuvel tries to convince Varman to leave him and his family alone, but to no avail. Enraged, he decides to fight back.        First, Muthuvel blackmails a psychiatrist S. Dhandapani into providing asylum for his family. He then visits Narasimha, a reformed criminal living in Mandya, who loans him four of his sharpest shooters. With the help of Narasimha's men, Muthuvel steals Varman's idols that were being smuggled and uses them to blackmail and humiliate Varman, who was about to kill his family. In response, Varman thires a Bihari gangster named Kamdev to send people to kill Muthuvel and his family at his home, but Muthuvel and Narasimha's men finish them off. On discovering Varman's target to be Muthuvel, Kamdev reveals to him that Muthuvel was the former ruthless and charismatic jailer of Tihar prison who disciplined the criminals harshly but also helped them reform, thus gaining a massive network of allies, including Kamdev.        Muthuvel corners Varman in his base along with a hundred men sent by another former criminal Sikandar Singh, but Varman reveals that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill him. Both of them ultimately arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in exchange for retrieving a famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Mangalagiri. Muthuvel plans a heist involving the Telugu actor Blast Mohan, who is a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. After various deceptions and with the help of a smuggler in Mumbai named Mathew, Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it to Varman, but it is later revealed that the crown which Muthuvel sent was a fake.        Varman frees Arjun, who reveals himself as a corrupt police officer wanting to be cut in on Varman's operations, willing to kill his own father for money. However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera and their entire conversation is seen by Muthuvel. He attacks Varman's hideout with Kamdev, Vimal, and his allies, killing Varman and his men, while Narasimha protects Muthuvel's family and Mathew destroys Varman's smuggling operations. Muthuvel gives Arjun one chance to surrender, but he refuses and attempts to kill him. Arjun is shot and killed by Narasimha's men, while Muthuvel solemnly walks away.",

        "description": "Fast X (also known as Fast & Furious 10) is a 2023 American action film directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay written by Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, both of whom also co-wrote the story with Zach Dean. It is the sequel to F9 (2021), the tenth main installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Ludacris Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Toretto must protect his family from Dante Reyes (Momoa), who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune. Dominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in Rome. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian Little B Marcos, while the rest of the team, consisting of Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Han Lue, and Ramsey, travels to Rome. A wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home and informs him and Letty that Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her and is using them to target Dom as revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] When Little Nobody says that there is no Agency mission in Rome, Dom and Letty realize that Dante set them up and they go to rescue the team.         In Rome, Dante releases a metal ball bomb into the streets. Dom pushes it into the Tiber River, minimizing the damage, but Letty is arrested. Agent Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance,[c] believes that Dom and his team are responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt. In Los Angeles, Dom's brother Jakob rescues Little B and Mia, his and Dom's sister, from a squad sent by Dante to kidnap Little B and with her approval, takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's daughter, Tess, is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye[d] to find Dom in Naples, informing him that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro.         There, Dom confronts Dante and meets Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's late mother Elena.[e] Dom later challenges Dante to a race, along with Isabel and his ally, Diogo. However, Dante wins while killing Diogo and injuring Isabel. Tess visits Letty at the black site and covertly wounds her to send her to the prison's treatment center, where Letty meets Cipher. They discover the black site is located in Antarctica and they must work together to escape. In London, Dom's team turns to Deckard Shaw for help, through the convincing of Han after a scuffle between himself and Deckard. Tess gets shot by the sniper and Dante steals the God's eye from Tess.         Aimes joins forces with Dom to fight Dante. Dante locates Little B in Portugal and kidnaps him. As Dom is cornered by mercenaries, Jakob sacrifices his life to take them all out, allowing Dom to rescue his son. Dante again corners Dom and his son, just as Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey arrive by plane to aid Dom. Realizing too late, Dom tells Roman to turn the plane around, but Aimes, revealed to be working for Dante, shoots down the plane, leaving each member of the team's fates unknown. Dom drives off the edge of the dam they are on to avoid Dante's trap, but Dante has the dam rigged with explosives and arms them, leaving Dom and Little B's fates unknown as well. In Antarctica, Gisele Yashar, who was presumed dead,[f] emerges from a submarine to rescue Letty and Cipher.         In a mid-credits scene, Luke Hobbs infiltrates an abandoned theatre with a team of agents where he is contacted by Dante who tells him that he will be his next target for killing his father.

        "description": "Five years after the events of the first film, Jonas Taylor has been involved in fighting environmental crimes while also helping Mana One in exploring a further deep part of the Mariana Trench where the Megalodon had been found. Following the death of Suyin Zhang, Jonas has been raising her teenage daughter Meiying alongside her uncle and Suyin's brother Jiuming Zhang, who has acquired his father's company alongside wealthy financier Hillary Driscoll. Mana One has also been studying an 80 ft (24 m) female Meg called Haiqi, who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan. Recently, Haiqi has been acting erratically, leading to Jonas being concerned despite Jiuming's enthusiasm. Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench, with Meiying stowing away to see the trench for the first time. Fellow Meg survivors DJ and Mac observe the group from the Mana One. On their way down, the subs are pursued by Haiqi, who escaped captivity the previous night; the subs dive down through the thermocline to escape, but Haiqi forces her way through it anyway. Two much larger Megs, a massive alpha male and a slightly smaller beta male, appear and mate with Haiqi. While working on an escape plan, Jonas and his team discover an illegal mining operation in a station captained by the mercenary Montes, who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes' crew was hired by the secretly corrupt Driscoll to covertly use the Mana One's access to the trench to farm rare earth minerals that could earn them billions. Montes kills his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities, which causes a rupture in the trench and grounds both Jonas’ and Jiuming's ships.         DJ, Mac, and fellow Mana One analyst Jess discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged, forcing the crew to use exosuits to walk towards the station in the creature-filled trench, with only Jonas, Meiying, Jiuming and security officer Rigas surviving the journey. Jess reveals herself as a traitor and attempts to remotely kill the four, but they escape the station in another submersible after a scuffle with Montes, who escapes to the surface through a buoy. Driscoll sends mercenaries to take over the Mana One while Montes surfaces and meets with Jess. As the crew surfaces, they discover the rupture from earlier which leads to several of the creatures, including the three Megs, a swarm of lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus escaping the trench and reaching the surface.         Jonas’ crew meets with DJ and Mac, and Montes focuses the mercenaries on the crew after Jess is devoured by a Meg. Jonas’ team escapes to a nearby resort, Fun Island, to warn them of the approaching creatures. Driscoll, Montes and the mercenaries arrive at Fun Island to eliminate Jonas’ crew, but they are instead attacked by the Snappers, who devour Driscoll and several mercenaries. Jonas’ group splits up to evacuate the tourists as the Megs and the octopus begin their attack. Jonas manages to kill the beta male Meg using an explosive taped to a harpoon before being attacked by Montes, leading both to sail to the beach. The two battle before Jonas knocks Montes into the mouth of the alpha Meg to be consumed. Jiuming creates a bomb out of fertilizer and along with Mac takes over Driscoll's unattended helicopter to fly towards the beach where Meiying is trying to help tourists.         The octopus takes down the helicopter and Jiuming injures it with his bomb, attracting Haiqi, who engages in a battle with the Octopus and proceeds to kill the beast. As Jiuming swims towards the wreckage to save Mac, Jonas picks up one of the helicopter's rotors and uses it to fatally impale the alpha Meg through the head. Haiqi heads towards Jonas, Jiuming, and Mac, but Jiuming uses his training signals to divert her attention. Haiqi redirects her attention to a pod of dolphins swimming away. Making their way to the beach, Jiuming reasons that Haiqi escaped captivity because it was mating season, and discusses the possibility that she is pregnant. Jonas decides that it is better not to think about it, and the group celebrate their survival.",

        "description": "The planet-eating Unicron attacks the homeworld of the Maximals, an advanced race of Transformers. The Terrorcons, Unicron’s heralds led by Scourge, want the Transwarp Key which can open portals through space and time and can help Unicron consume planets faster. The Maximal leader Apelinq sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. Now under the command of Optimus Primal, the Maximals flee to Earth with the key. In 1994 Brooklyn, Noah Diaz, an ex-military electronics expert, struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris and is convinced by his friend Reek to steal a Porsche to sell only to discover that it is the Autobot Mirage in disguise. Concurrently, museum intern Elena Wallace studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime, who summons the other Autobots, including Arcee and Bumblebee. Mirage is contacted in the middle of Noah's attempted theft, and he is roped into the Autobots' mission to recover the key so they can use it to return to their homeworld, Cybertron.         Drawn by the key's signature, the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum, with Elena becoming caught up in the conflict. Scourge kills Bumblebee, steals the key, and retreats when the Maximal Airazor arrives. Airazor reveals that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth for millennia, and Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key, which was split in two to keep it away from Unicron. Optimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home, while Noah secretly plots to destroy the key to keep Earth safe.         Elena deduces that the other half of the key is in a hidden temple in Peru. The cargo plane Autobot, Stratosphere takes them to Peru, where they meet with Wheeljack, who leads them to the temple. However, the other half of the key is revealed to no longer be there. The Terrorcons attack again, and Scourge corrupts Airazor with Unicron's dark energy. Subsequently, the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the other Maximals, who entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennia. Scourge's corruption overtakes Airazor, whom Primal reluctantly kills at her request to save Elena. In the chaos, Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key, but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves, erecting a tower and opening a portal above the Earth, which Unicron will soon go through.         Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their homeworlds from Unicron. While Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army, Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key, planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered. During the battle, Scourge wounds Mirage, who was protecting Noah, but transforms his damaged body into a powered exo-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley. He helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle. Optimus kills Scourge, but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal, willing to sacrifice himself, but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex, which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army and leaves Unicron stranded.         In the aftermath, the Autobots, unable to return to Cybertron, proclaim Earth as their new home and vow to continue protecting it alongside the Maximals. Elena receives recognition for discovering the temple in Peru while Noah attends an interview for a security job but finds he is actually being invited to join the secret military organization G.I. Joe, who will cover Kris's healthcare.         In a mid-credits scene, Noah repairs Mirage using junk Porsche parts from Reek who claims it is unroad-worthy, and Noah disproves him by calling to Mirage to transform in front of Reek.",

        "description":"The planet Cybertron was ravaged by a civil war between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron, for the AllSpark, a cube-like object that is the source of all Cybertronian life. The Autobots want to find the AllSpark so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons want to use it to defeat the Autobots and conquer the universe. Megatron found the AllSpark on Earth, but crash-landed in the Arctic Circle and was frozen in the ice. Captain Archibald Witwicky and his crew of explorers stumbled upon Megatron in 1897. Captain Witwicky accidentally activates Megatron's navigational system, causing his eyeglasses to be imprinted with the coordinates of the AllSpark's location. Sector 7, a secret United States government organization, discovers the AllSpark in the Colorado River and builds the Hoover Dam around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron is moved into this facility and is reverse engineered to advance human technology. In the present day, the Decepticons—Blackout, Scorponok, Frenzy, Barricade, Starscream, Bonecrusher and Brawl—have landed on Earth and assumed the disguise of Earth vehicles. Blackout and Scorponok attack the U.S. SOCCENT military base in Qatar and try to hack into the U.S. military network to find the location of Megatron and the AllSpark. Their mission is thwarted when the base staff severs the network cable connections. While Blackout destroys the rest of the base, Scorponok chases a small group of survivors who have photographic evidence of the robots, but he is eventually repelled. During this battle, the military discovers its only effective weapons against the Transformers' armor are high-heat sabot rounds. After Blackout's failure, Frenzy infiltrates Air Force One to try again to hack into the military network, and in doing so plants a virus. He finds the map imprinted on Captain Witwicky's glasses which is owned by his descendant, Sam Witwicky. Frenzy and Barricade begin tracking Sam's location in Los Angeles.         One of the Autobots, Bumblebee, is also on Earth, disguised as a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro,[6] and is bought by Sam while shopping for his first car. Bumblebee helps him woo his crush, Mikaela Banes. Bumblebee leaves at night to transmit a homing beacon to the Autobots and Sam sees him in robot mode. Barricade confronts Sam and demands Archibald's spectacles, but Bumblebee rescues him and Mikaela. After Bumblebee upgrades his vehicle form by scanning a 2007 Chevrolet Camaro, they leave to rendezvous with the Autobots: Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet—who have landed on Earth and taken the forms of Earth vehicles as well. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots return to Sam's home and obtain the glasses. Soon, agents from Sector 7 arrive to arrest Sam and Mikaela, and they capture Bumblebee.         Frenzy, disguised as a mobile phone, secretly accompanies the group to the Hoover Dam and releases Megatron. Locating the AllSpark, Frenzy alerts the other Decepticons. Sam convinces the Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can get the AllSpark to Optimus Prime. Frenzy's virus has shut down government communications, but a pair of hackers manage to establish a signal to the Air Force. The Autobot-human convoy goes to Mission City, Nevada to obtain a radio that will guide the Air Force and secure an extraction for the AllSpark as the Decepticon forces attack the convoy. During the ensuing battle, Brawl, Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, and Blackout are all killed. Sam manages to ram the AllSpark into Megatron's chest, killing him and destroying the AllSpark. Optimus takes a fragment of the AllSpark from Megatron's corpse but realizes that with its destruction, their homeworld Cybertron cannot be restored. The government decommissions Sector 7 and dumps the corpses of the defeated Decepticons into the Laurentian Abyss. Sam and Mikaela begin a relationship, and Optimus sends a signal to other surviving Autobots directing them to Earth.",

        "description":"In 17,000 B.C., the Primes (the highest ruling Cybertronians) gather their energy, Energon, from sun harvesters, machines that consume stars to harness their energy. The Primes have a sacred rule to never deplete a star that sustains life. One Prime violates this rule by building a sun harvester on Earth, for which he was defeated by the other six Primes, and becomes the Fallen, the original Decepticon. In 2009, two years after the battle of Mission City,[a] the Autobots and the humans have formed NEST (Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty), a classified joint task force to eliminate the remaining Decepticons. Two of them, Sideways and Demolishor, are defeated in Shanghai, but the latter warns of the Fallen's return before being killed. Meanwhile, the Decepticon Soundwave hacks a military satellite to track and steal the last known piece of the AllSpark shard from a U.S Navy base in Diego Garcia. They use it to resurrect Megatron, and Megatron returns to the Fallen. The Fallen sends Megatron and his second-in-command, Starscream, to capture Sam Witwicky alive and kill Optimus.         Meanwhile, Sam, now attending college at Princeton University, has been seeing Cybertronian symbols since holding a smaller AllSpark shard; Megatron believes the symbols will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source. The shard brings many of the kitchen appliances to life, which attempt to kill Sam and his parents but Bumblebee rescues them. Sam gives the shard to his girlfriend Mikaela Banes, who later captures the Decepticon Wheelie as he attempts to steal it. After being attacked by Alice, a Decepticon Pretender posing as a college student, Sam, his roommate Leo, and Mikaela are captured by the Decepticon Grindor before the Autobots save them. Optimus fights off Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor before Optimus kills Grindor. Megatron then kills Optimus while he defends Sam, and the Decepticons launch devastating attacks around the world, while Megatron and Soundwave hijack Earth's telecommunications systems, which allows the Fallen to send a message to the humans, demanding that Sam be handed over to him.         Sam, Mikaela, and Leo then find alien expert and former Sector Seven agent, Seymour Simmons, who reveals the Transformers visited Earth for a long time and the most ancient, known as Seekers, remained hidden on Earth. With help from Wheelie, they track down an elderly Decepticon turned Autobot Seeker named Jetfire at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to Egypt. Along with Jetfire, Wheelie sides with the Autobots, and Jetfire sends them to locate the Matrix of Leadership, the sun harvester's key, which could also be used to revive Optimus. The group finds the Matrix, whom the Primes sacrificed themselves to hide, in Aqaba, but it disintegrates into dust.         Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the Giza pyramid complex and are attacked by the Decepticons. The Constructicons combine to form Devastator, who reveal the sun harvester hidden inside a pyramid before he is destroyed. A majority of the Decepticons are annihilated by multiple airstrikes from the Navy and the U.S Air Force, but Megatron manages to kill Sam. The Primes speak to Sam, saying that the Matrix must be earned, not found and that he has the right to bear it by sacrificing himself for Optimus. They resurrect Sam and grant him the Matrix, which he uses to resurrect Optimus. The Fallen steals the Matrix from a weakened Optimus and uses it to activate the sun harvester. After a wounded Jetfire sacrifices himself to allow his parts to be used for additional power and flight, Optimus destroys the harvester and kills the Fallen. Heavily damaged and distraught by his master's death, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The Autobots and their allies then return to the United States, and Sam and Leo return to college.",

        "description":"In 1960, the Ark, a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between Autobots and Decepticons, crash lands on the dark side of Earth's Moon and is detected by NASA. President John F. Kennedy authorizes a mission to put a man on the Moon as a cover for investigating the spacecraft. In 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 lands on the Moon and secretly inspects the Ark before returning to Earth. In the present day, four years after Egypt,[a] the Autobots assist humanity in preventing major conflicts. During a mission to the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to investigate suspected alien technology, the Autobots are attacked by Decepticon scientist Shockwave and his giant worm Driller. After the two escape, Optimus Prime discovers that the technology is a fuel cell from the Ark, thought to have been lost after escaping Cybertron. The Autobots travel to the Moon and discover Sentinel Prime, the Autobots' leader before Optimus, in a comatose state along with five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a Space Bridge, a wormhole able to teleport matter between two points. On Earth, Optimus uses the energy of the Matrix of Leadership to revive Sentinel.          Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky lives with his new girlfriend, Carly Spencer but is unable to work with the Autobots. At his new job, co-worker Jerry Wang gives him information about the Ark, before being assassinated by the Decepticon Laserbeak. It is revealed that the Decepticons are murdering people connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the Ark. Sam contacts Seymour Simmons, and they locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. The Decepticons raided the Ark long before the Apollo 11 mission and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, knowing that Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars. Meanwhile, Sam and the Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons and return Sentinel to their base. However, he betrays them by revealing that he made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival before killing Ironhide.          Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Dylan Gould, Carly's boss, is revealed to be working with them. With the help of Soundwave, he captures Carly. At the demand of the Decepticons, the Autobots are exiled from Earth. However, as their ship leaves Earth, it is destroyed by Starscream, seemingly killing them. The Decepticons invade Chicago while placing Pillars around the world to begin transporting their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System. They want to use Earth's resources to rebuild their world, enslaving humanity in the process. Sam teams up with former NEST soldier Robert Epps to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan. However, they are nearly killed by the Decepticons before the Autobots intervene. It turns out that the Autobots faked their death to gain an advantage over the Decepticons. Sam, along with NEST teams led by Lennox, and Navy SEALs, rescue Carly and begin fighting off the Decepticons. During the battle, Que is executed, and Bumblebee kills Soundwave while Optimus fights Sentinel. Laserbeak, Starscream, the Driller, and Shockwave are also killed in the ensuing battle.          Sam fights Dylan and knocks him into the Pillar, electrocuting and killing him. Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Meanwhile, Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as the leader of the Decepticons. While fighting, Sentinel is about to kill Optimus before he is incapacitated by Megatron, who is determined to regain his leadership. Megatron then offers a truce, but Optimus refuses and kills Megatron by decapitating him. Sentinel tries to reason his actions to Optimus but is executed by him for his betrayal. Sam and Carly are reunited, and the Autobots remain on Earth as their permanent home.",

        "description":" Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the Creators used devices called Seeds to cover Earth with a metallic alloy called Transformium, wiping out the dinosaurs in the process. In the present day, geologist Darcy Tirrel excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, who use it to build Transformer drones. Five years later, despite the efforts after the Battle of Chicago,[a] humans view Transformers as hostile and terminate all joint operations with them. Though the public believes that the Autobots were granted sanctuary, they are hunted down by a rogue CIA black ops division, Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic, rogue intelligence operative Harold Attinger, who believes that all Transformers are dangerous and must be destroyed. Lockdown, a Cybertronian assassin and bounty hunter working for the Creators, is tasked to find Optimus Prime. In exchange, he gives Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture Optimus. Lockdown locates and kills Ratchet when he refuses to give up Optimus's location.         Optimus, badly damaged in Mexico City, hides in Texas and is discovered by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling inventor and a single father. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities, Cade instead fixes Optimus. Hoping to collect an advertised reward, Lucas alerts the authorities, and James Savoy, Attinger's field commanding operative, attacks the Yeager farm, but Optimus, and Tessa's secret boyfriend, Irish rally car driver Shane Dyson, rescue the family. During the pursuit, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Optimus summons the surviving Autobots – Bumblebee, Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs. Using a stolen CIA drone, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement with Cemetery Wind and the attacks on the Autobots.         Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in Chicago, Cade discovers the dead Autobots and Decepticons being melted down to make Transformer drones. The K.S.I. CEO, Joshua Joyce, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed to make more Transformium. He has also used the captured Brains and Megatron's head to create prototype Transformer soldiers, Galvatron and Stinger. The Autobots storm the building and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua declares that they don't need them anymore. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to capture the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes erratic. As Galvatron battles Optimus, he gets autonomously freed from control. Suddenly, Lockdown arrives and abducts both Optimus and Tessa while Galvatron retreats.         While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots sneak on board to rescue Optimus and Tessa. They hijack a smaller ship, containing other Transformers called the Dinobots, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots learn that Galvatron is Megatron reincarnated, plotting to use the Seed and the Transformer drones to conquer the world, and that KSI plans to use the Seed in the Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua, who agrees to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Galvatron reactivates himself and takes control of the drones. A battle follows in Hong Kong between the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, and the drones. During the fight, Cade sends Savoy plummeting to his death while Optimus frees the Dinobots and wins their allegiance through trial by combat, becoming essential to the Autobots' victory.         Lockdown returns to recapture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large magnet to cause destruction. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger to save Cade, but the distraction allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down with his sword. Cade ends up fighting Lockdown one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown before defeating the remaining drones with Lockdown's grenades. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return. Optimus asks the Autobots to protect the Yeagers while Joshua offers to help them build a new home, before flying away into space with the Seed, sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them.[b]",
